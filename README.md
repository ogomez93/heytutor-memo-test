# heytutor-memo-test
A Memo Test game made by [Oswaldo Gomez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/o-gomez93/?locale=en_US) in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the code challenge to join [HeyTutor](https://heytutor.com/) as a Front-End dev.

## How to run it locally

We're assuming that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed, either a specific version or with a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) (using `nvm` is highly recommended). Also, you'll need to have either [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) installed. If you already have `nvm` then you won't need to install `npm` because it comes with `nvm`.

This project was built using Node.js v16.14.0, but I'd suggest to just use the latest LTS. This is where `nvm` comes handy.

Once you're sure that you have the previous tools installed:
1. open your terminal,
2. clone the repo,
3. move to the root directory of the repo, and 
4. install all the dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

And then just visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and enjoy. It's fully responsive, and it has light and dark themes support!
